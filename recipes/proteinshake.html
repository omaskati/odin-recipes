    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for a simple. quick protein shake with no added sugar and all-natural ingredients that still tastes great!
        For this to work, you do need to look into buying an unflavored protein powder. Alternatively, you could also look to use plain yogurt or greek yogurt if you prefer. I use unflavored whey protein, but if you are vegan,
        an unflavored vegan protein powder will work, as well. You will probably need to increase the amounts of certain other ingredients, though,
        in order to get it tasting right. (I've used unflavored pea proteins and brown rice proteins in the past, and their earthy flavor can be pretty overpowering. Experiment to find what works for you.)
    </p>
    <p>The goal is to keep our ingredients to a minimum, and keeping them all-natural. 
        We'll get our sweetness from natural sources, using banana. If you need extra sweetness, dates are a good option to add, too.
        For the chocolate lovers out there, we'll use cocoa powder (100% cacao). And that's really it! But feel free to get creative 
        with other tasty, natural ingredients like shredded coconut or berries or your favorite natural nut butter. Let's get to the recipe!
